Sen. Marco Rubio told Politico he won’t participate in town hall meetings because political activists will crash them to create a media spectacle of people who “heckle and scream at me in front of cameras.”&lt;/p&gt;

Tallahassee’s material response has been wonderful. Now those orchestrating this could use some more physical help in loading the trucks, sorting and packing goods, and cleaning up when all is said and done.
They don’t need more material goods right now. But more money is very helpful. You can deliver money to them there, or walk into any Prime Meridian Bank branch in Tallahassee or Thomasville and hand them a check made out to Puerto Rico Relief Fund. These monies will help put fuel into the plane, or maybe even charter a second plane. The pilots are working for free.
