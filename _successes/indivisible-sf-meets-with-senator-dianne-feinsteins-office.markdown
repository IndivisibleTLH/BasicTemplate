This is the scene at 2888 Mahan Drive today, where donations to those suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico are being gathered for a private plane flight to that island.
Tallahassee's material response has been wonderful. Now those orchestrating this could use some more physical help in loading the trucks, sorting and packing goods, and cleaning up when all is said and done.
They don't need more material goods right now. But more money is very helpful. You can deliver money to them there, or walk into any Prime Meridian Bank branch in Tallahassee or Thomasville and hand them a check made out to Puerto Rico Relief Fund. These monies will help put fuel into the plane, or maybe even charter a second plane. The pilots are working for free.
The Tallahassee lawyer who started this effort -- originally from Puerto Rico herself, but living and practicing here now -- has relatives in Puerto Rico who will receive and distribute these particular goods much faster than what you hear about on national news right now.
