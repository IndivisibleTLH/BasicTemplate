Hopefully FSU fans took minute to do some old-fashioned grassroots politicking at the FSU-NC State game. A light plane flew an aerial advertisement over Doak Campbell with 7’ high letters urging fans to take out their cell phones and call Sen. Marco Rubio’s office immediately to leave a voicemail, VOTE NO ON #TRUMPCARE. The senator had said he’s undecided about his vote.
The Tallahassee volunteers who donated funding for the cost of the banner, hoped the crowd took a moment to engage in active citizenship in the midst of the revelry. Raise your voice- it matters!
